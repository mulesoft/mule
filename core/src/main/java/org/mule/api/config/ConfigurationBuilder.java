 * A <code>ConfigurationBuilder</code> is used to configure a Mule instance,

 * to configure a single mule instance with each ConfigurationBuilder doing one of
 * more of the following:
 * <li> Creation of mule runtime artifacts (endpoint's, connector's, service's,
 * transformer's) which are then registered with the <code>Registy</code
 * <li> Creation and registration of SecurityManager / TransactionManager / TransactionManagerFactory / QueueManager
 * and ThreadingProfile's.  Unlike the runtime artifacts mule only uses a single instance of each of these and so if
 * multiple configuration builder create and register these artifacts only one will be used.
 * <li> Configuration of existing Mule configuration related artifacts such as <code>MuleConfiguration</code> and
 * <code>ServerNotificationManager</code>
 * <br/><br/>
 * Which of the above takes place, depends on what the configuration source contains and the ConfgurationBuilder implementation is used.
