 * Objects that have an associated lifecycle manager such as {@link Service} or

 * have a different lifecycle state to the registry. Typically objects that have
 * their own lifecycle manager can be controlled externally through JMX which means
 * there is no guarantee that the state of the object is in the same lifecycle state
 * of the registry, hence the need to introspect the lifecycle state of an object.
