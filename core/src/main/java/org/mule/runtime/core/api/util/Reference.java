/**
 * An object which holds a reference to a given {@link #value}.
 * <p>
 * Because this class represents a reference to such value
 * instead of just being a simple holder, the {@link #equals(Object)}
 * has been redefined to test that the two values are actually
 * the same ('{@code ==}'). Consistently, the {@link #hashCode()}
 * method is defined to return the value's identity hash code.
 * <p>
 * The above makes this class useful for cases in which
 * you need to build a set of unique references, without
 * depending on the actual {@link #equals(Object)} and
 * {@link #hashCode()} implementations.
 * <p>
 * {@code null} references are also supported.
