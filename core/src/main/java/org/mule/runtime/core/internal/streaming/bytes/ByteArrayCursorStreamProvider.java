/**
 * A {@link CursorStreamProvider} which is backed by a fixed {@link byte[]}.
 * <p>
 * Notice that since the {@link #content} data is already fully loaded into memory, this kind of
 * defeats the purpose of the cursor provider. The purpose of this method is to provide a way to
 * bridge the given data with the {@link CursorStreamProvider} abstraction. Possible use cases are
 * mainly deserialization and testing. <b>Think twice</b> before using this method. Most likely you're
 * doing something wrong.
 * <p>
 * Also consider that because the data is already in memory, the cursors will never buffer into disk.
