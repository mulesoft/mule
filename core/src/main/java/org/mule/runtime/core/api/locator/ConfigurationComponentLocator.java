 * Global elements that do not have a name cannot be referenced.

 * The following parts must be components contained within the global element. Location "myFlow/processors" indicates the

 *
 * Each part must be contained in the preceded component in the location. Location "myFlow/errorHandler/onErrors" indicates the
 * onErrors components that are part of the errorHandler component which is also part of the "myFlow" global element.
 *
 * When a component part has a collection of components, each component can be referenced individually with an index. THe first
 * index is 0. Location "myFlow/processors/4" refers to the fifth processors inside the flow with name "myFlow"
