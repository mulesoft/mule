/**
 * Provides access to the different schedulers and thread pools that exist in the Mule runtime, allowing an artifact to schedule
 * tasks on those.
 * <p>
 * This interface provides access to different schedulers, each with its own configured tuning options (TODO MULE-10585),
 * optimized for some specific kind of work. Artifacts that need to dispatch tasks need to carefully determine which scheduler
 * best fits the nature of the task in order to keep the resources usage and the impact on other artifacts at a minimum.
 * <p>
 * The {@link Scheduler}s returned by methods in the implementations must provide access the the thread pools in the Mule Runtime
 * that have the expected tuning configuration. Each {@link Scheduler} will have its own lifecycle, managed by its user and NOT
 * this service.
