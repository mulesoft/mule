/**
 * Defines that when the test is going to be run with an {@link ArtifactClassLoaderRunner} it would need to get access to the
 * {@link ArtifactsClassLoaderHolder} created by the launcher class loader
 * in order to load classes with the {@link org.mule.runtime.module.artifact.classloader.ArtifactClassLoader}s created.
 * <p/>
 * A private static method should be defined and annotated with this annotation in order to be called by the runner so the test
 * later could get access to the {@link org.mule.runtime.module.artifact.classloader.ArtifactClassLoader}s. Only one method
 * should be annotated with this annotation.
 * <p/>
 * Be aware that as the test would be loaded with the isolated class loader it cannot use
 * {@link ArtifactsClassLoaderHolder} neither
 * {@link org.mule.runtime.module.artifact.classloader.ArtifactClassLoader} due to mismatching type between class loader so
 * these objects will need to be used with reflection.
 * <p/>
 * The annotated method mentioned in previous paragraph would have to receive an {@link Object} parameter type.
 * <p/>
 * For more information, see {@link org.mule.functional.junit4.ArtifactFunctionalTestCase} where this is used.

 * @since 4.0
