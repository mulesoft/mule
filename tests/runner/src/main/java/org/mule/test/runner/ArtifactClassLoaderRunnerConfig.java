 * Specifies a configuration needed by {@link ArtifactClassLoaderRunner} in order to run the tests in the module.
 * <p/>
 * Be aware that this annotation will be loaded for the whole module being tested, it is not supported to have different annotated
 * values for different test classes due to in order to improve the performance a {@link ClassLoader} is created only the first
 * time and used to run several tests.
 * <p/>
 * A best practice is to have a base abstract class for your module tests that extends
 * {@link org.mule.functional.junit4.ArtifactFunctionalTestCase} or
 * {@link org.mule.functional.junit4.MuleArtifactFunctionalTestCase} for mule internal tests, to define the isolation runner
 * configuration using {@code this} annotation that applies to all the tests that are being executed for the same module.
 * <p/>
 * The concept of module of execution is being backed by a JVM where a JVM is created for running the whole test of the module, in
 * case of maven either IDEs.
