/**
 * This class (as it's name implies) provides connection instances and the funcionality to disconnect and validate those
 * connections.
 * <p>
 * All connection related parameters (values required in order to create a connection) must be
 * declared in the connection providers.
 * <p>
 * This particular example is a {@link PoolingConnectionProvider} which declares that connections resolved by this provider
 * will be pooled and reused. There are other implementations like {@link CachedConnectionProvider} which lazily creates and
 * caches connections or simply {@link ConnectionProvider} if you want a new connection each time something requires one.
