I wonder if we'll smile
In our coffins while
Loved ones mourn the day
Absence of our face
Living, laughing, eyes awake
Is this too much for them to take?
Too young for ones conclusion
The lifestyle won
Such values you taught your son
That's how
Look at me now!
I'm broken!
Inherit my life
I'm broken!
One day we all will die
Clichéd fact of life
Force fed to make us heed
Inbred to sponge our bleed
Every warning, a leaking rubber
A poison apple for mingled blood
Too young for ones delusion
The lifestyle cost
Venereal mother embrace the loss
That's how
Look at you now!
You're broken!
Inherit your life
You're broken!
That's how
Look at us now!
I'm broken!
Inherit my life
I'm broken!
That's how
Look at me now!
I'm broken!
I'm broken!
I'm broken!
I'm broke!
