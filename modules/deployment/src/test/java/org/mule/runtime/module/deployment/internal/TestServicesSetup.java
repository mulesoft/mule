/**
 * TestRule used to build the mule services before executing the tests. It's intended to be used as a {@link org.junit.ClassRule}
 * instead of using it as a {@link org.junit.Rule}, because the service building process is time expensive.
 * <p>
 * After building the services, you can use the methods {@link #overrideSchedulerService(Function)},
 * {@link #overrideExpressionLanguageMetadataService(Function)}, and {@link #overrideExpressionLanguageService(Function)} to
 * override the default test implementations. You have to pass a {@link Function} that receives the folder where the service
 * should be built, and builds the service.
 * <p>
 * Once that you created this rule, and optionally overwrote some services, you have to call {@link #copyServicesToFolder(File)}
 * in order to copy the implementations to the corresponding folder. This allows you to use only one muleHome folder per suite or
 * one per test, according to your needs.
 * <p>
 * Note: After some profiling in the deployment test cases, we noticed that the expensive part of setting the services up is to
 * compile and build them, and not copying them to the muleHome folder.
