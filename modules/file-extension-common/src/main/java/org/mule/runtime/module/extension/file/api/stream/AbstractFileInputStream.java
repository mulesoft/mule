/**
 * Base class for {@link InputStream} instances returned by connectors
 * which operate over a {@link FileSystem}.
 * <p>
 * It's an {@link AutoCloseInputStream} which also contains the concept
 * of a {@link PathLock} which is released when the stream is closed
 * or fully consumed.
 * <p>
 * Because in most implementations the actual reading of the stream
 * requires initialising/maintaining a connection, instances are created
 * through a {@link LazyStreamSupplier}. This allows such connection/resource
 * to be provisioned lazily. This is very useful in cases such as
 * {@link FileSystem#list(String, boolean, MuleMessage, Predicate)}. Being
 * able to only lazily establish the connections, prevents the connector
 * from opening many connections at the same time, at the risk that many of
 * them might end up not being necessary at the same place.
