30=Welcome to the Mule Loan Broker ESB example. This example demonstrates using JMS, Web Services,\n Http/Rest and EJBs using an ESB architecture.\nFor more information see http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/MULE3EXAMPLES/Loan+Broker+Example.\n\nThe example demonstrates integrating EJB applications in 2 ways -\n  1. Calling out to a remote EJB using a Mule Endpoint.\n  2. Managing an EJB as a Mule component.\n\nBoth have the same behavior but the second method allows a remote EJB to be used as if it were\n a local Mule component, thereby enabling tighter integration.\n\nPlease select [1], [2] or [q] quit:
