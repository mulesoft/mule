# Building Mule

[Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) is the build automation tool used in Mule Runtime. To modify or add to Mule source code, it's specially relevant to understand the hierarchy of maven projects that represent the Mule source code.  

To be able to build Mule you will need Maven among other things. Refer to the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file to find the installation instructions and prerequisites necessary to build Mule.

In the following sections you will learn how Mule is organized, how to build Mule and how to troubleshoot problems we might find.

### Mule Source Code Sub-projects

The Mule source code project is neatly organized into a hierarchy of sub-projects. (Sub-projects are sometimes referred to as "modules," but to avoid confusion with Mule modules, we use "sub-projects".) Each sub-project generally produces one Maven artifact, usually a JAR file. The Mule build is structured using intermediate project object models (POMs) to group common sub-projects together. These intermediate sub-projects are sub-folders of the source code's mule folder, and are described in the table below.

| Sub-project       | Description  |  
|-------------------|--------------|  
| `buildtools`      | tools to build Mule, scripts, and checkstyle configuration |
| `core`            | Mule's core API and functionality that is required by all transports distributions       |  
| `builds`          | the various distributions (refer to the Distributions section below for further details)    |  
| `examples`        | examples that come with the full Mule distribution |
| `modules`         | non-transport extensions to Mule, such as XML processing, Spring extras, or scripting support
| `tests`           | tests that can be run as part of the Mule build |
| `tools`           | tools for Mule, such as the transport and project Maven archetypes |
| `transports`      | Mule transports such as the JMS, VM, and TCP transports |
 

### Building Mule

The following table lists common goals to execute for building Mule. These goals are standard Maven goals, refer to [Maven's documentation](http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html#Running_Maven_Tools) for more info on them.

|Command | Description |
|:----------|:-------------|
| `mvn clean`	 | purges any built artifacts or intermediate files (such as .class) from the target directory |
| `mvn install` | installs all modules but the distributions to your local repository, will run all tests but the ones that have external dependencies. |
| `mvn install -Pdistributions` | installs all modules and distributions to your local repository. |
| `mvn install -Prelease` | same as `mvn install` including sources, tests, javadocs and GPG signatures. |
| `mvn install -Prelease -DskipGpg=true` | same as `mvn install -Prelease` without GPG signatures. |
| `mvn install -Pdistributions,release` | installs all jars, distributions including sources, tests, javadocs and GPG signatures. |
| `mvn test`    | runs any unit tests for this sub-project |
| `mvn -DskipTests install` |	By default, Maven runs all unit tests for each project for each build which, depending on the project, can take a long time to complete. If you wish, you can skip the tests using this command.|
 
#### Build properties

In addition to the standard properties, the following ones can change the behaviour of the Mule build:

| Property                  | Default      | Description  |
|:--------------------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| `skipIntegrationTests`	   | `false`      | Skip flag for integration tests |
| `skipFunctionalTests`	   | `true`      | Skip flag for functional tests |
| `skipSystemTests`         | `true`       | Skip flag for container level tests |
| `skipPerformanceTests`    | `true`       | Skip flag for performance tests |
| `skipArchetypeTests`      | `true`       | Skip flag for the archetype tests|
| `skipVerifications`       | `false`      | Skip flag for the license check, version enforce, style checks, etc.|
| `skipInstalls`            | `false`      | Disable installation of artifacts in the local maven repository|
| `skipGpg`                 | `true`       | Skip artifact signing, as it does require special setup|
| `skipDistributions`       | `true`      | Skip flag for the distribution files creation |

To set these properties, it's necessary to pass them in the maven command line as `-DPropertyName=value` where value is optional for `true`. Therefore, to disable the distribution creation skip we could use `-DskipDistributions=false` while to skip the integration tests we can `-DskipIntegrationTests`.

It is important to remember that the rest of the maven plugins flags are still applicable, for instance to disable tests in the surefire plugin we could do: `-DskipTests`.

#### Build profiles

Along with the [Build properties](#build-properties) the Mule build has a number of Maven profiles (see Maven's guide on profiles [here](http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-profiles.html)). These profiles can activate build properties or configure other build behaviors.

The following list shows the Mule's build profiles:

| Property                  | Description                                                       |
|:--------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `unit`                	   | Only tests annotated with `org.mule.tck.size.SmallTest` will run.|
| `functional`              | Will just run functional tests, located in [/tests/functional](mule/tree/3.x/tests/functional). |
| `integration`             | Will just run integration tests, located in [/tests/integration](mule/tree/3.x/tests/integration). |
| `system`                  | Will just run system tests. |
| `release`                 | Won't execute any tests and will create the distributable files.|

To set these profiles,  we should pass them in the maven command line as `-PprofileName`. Therefore, to disable the distribution creation skip we could use `-DskipDistributions=false` while to skip the integration tests we can `-DskipIntegrationTests`.

####Â Distributions

When you package Mule for distribution, all distributions and related resources are located in the distributions sub-project. 

For performance's sake, the distributions are *not* built from the project's top-level directory by default. You may either build a distribution from its own directory, or disable the `distributions` skip flag  by adding `-DskipDistributions=false` to your Maven command line.

The table below offers a brief description of each type distribution.

|Type                           | Sub-project	                   |Description       |
|:------------------------------|:-------------------------------|:-----------------|
| Full Standalone Server        | `/distributions/standalone`   | Packages Mule as a stand-alone server application. Includes all transports, extras and all dependencies. Includes the [Java Service Wrapper](http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.org/) for starting/stopping/restarting Mule from the native OS. |
| Custom Standalone Server      | `/distributions/standalone-light` | Packages Mule as a standalone server application without any source or javadoc files |
| Embedded (Composite) JAR File | `/distribution/embedded` | Packages Mule as a single JAR file containing all Mule classes, including all transports and extras). This distribution is useful when embedding Mule into another application, or when using Mule with a non-Maven-based build. Note that when you use this approach, you are responsible for providing any needed Mule dependencies, as described in the next section. |
 

### Troubleshooting Maven

This section describes some problems you might experience using Maven and how to resolve or work around them.

| Problem                             | Description  |  Solution    |
|:------------------------------------|:-------------|:------------| 
| Files could not be retrieved	       | You are behind a firewall and get an error stating that repository metadata for org.mule.tools could not be retrieved from the central repository.|Check the proxy settings in your Maven settings.xml file to confirm that they are configured correctly.|
|OutOfMemory Error                    | You encounter OutOfMemoryError exceptions when attempting a full build of Mule.| Increasing the max heap and the PermGen space sizes. To do so, either export a MAVEN_OPTS variable in your shell, or add the variable to the original mvn script. Use the following: `MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m` |
|Slow build                           | 	-	 |If you know your downloads are up-to-date, you can use the offline option using the following command: `mvn -o` |
| Conflicting transitive dependencies | Transitive dependencies in m2 are both powerful and problematic at times. For example, you many have conflicting library versions or when unwanted libraries are in your classpath.|	Use the debug option to display the effective classpath in a tree format, making it easy to see where each library is coming from: `mvn -x` |
| Running a goal for a specific project| By default, Maven execute a goal for a project and all sub-projects in its hierarchy. |	If you want to run the goal for a specific project only (and not its children), you can use the non-recursive option: `mvn -N` |
| Debugging test failures | 	Surefire, the default Maven test runner, outputs all reports as a set of XML and text files. Any test failure details and stack traces are written to those files instead of the console, so it can be time consuming to open files to find problems. | You can redirect the output to the console temporarily by adding the following option: `mvn -Dsurefire.useFile=false`. This option skips creation of the text report, but still makes the XML report available for transformation by tools. |
