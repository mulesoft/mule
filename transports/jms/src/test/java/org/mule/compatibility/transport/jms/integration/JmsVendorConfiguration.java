/**
 * Abstracts all the Jms Vendor specific configuration for the Jms integration test suite.
 * An implementation of this class must be created for each Jms Vendor that gets tested.
 *
 * The integration tests use a fixed set of destination names since some Jms vendors require
 * that all destinations are configured beforehand.  The queue configurations that must be
 * made available are:
 *
 * - 'in' Queue
 * - 'middle' Queue
 * - 'middle2' Queue
 * - 'middle3' Queue
 * - 'out' Queue
 * - 'broadcast' Topic
 *
 * Also, there will need to be a {@link javax.jms.QueueConnectionFactory}, {@link javax.jms.TopicConnectionFactory},
 * {@link javax.jms.XAQueueConnectionFactory} and {@link javax.jms.XATopicConnectionFactory} available. These will be
 * used to create JMS {@link javax.jms.Connection} objects using the {@link #getConnection(boolean, boolean)} method of
 * this class.
 *
 * Note that this class defines a single method for {@link #getMiddleDestinationName()} but the {@link AbstractJmsFunctionalTestCase}
 * will made available 'middle' destination references i.e. 'middle2' and 'middle3'.
 *
 * Fore more inforation about the JMS Integration tests see {@link AbstractJmsFunctionalTestCase}
