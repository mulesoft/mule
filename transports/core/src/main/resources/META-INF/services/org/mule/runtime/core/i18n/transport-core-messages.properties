19=Message Details:

31=No component implementation found as local reference using: {0}
32=Cannot perform an action on a connector when it is not started. Connector "{0}" is currently in lifecycle phase "{1}"
33=Connector that caused exception is: {0}
34=Endpoint cannot be null when registering a listener
35=There is already a listener registered on this connector on endpointUri: {0}
36=Connector "{0}" has not been started. Cannot create dispatcher
37=Object "{0}" has already been initialised
51=The endpoint "{0}" is malformed and cannot be parsed.  If this is the name of a global endpoint, check the name is correct, that the endpoint exists, and that you are using the correct configuration (eg the "ref" attribute).  Note that names on inbound and outbound endpoints cannot be used to send or receive messages; use a named global endpoint instead.
54=The transformer "{0}" does not support source type "{1}". Endpoint is "{2}"
59=Message type "{0}" is not supported by message factory "{1}"

72=Failed to route event to component "{0}". The endpoint received on is "{0}"
73=Failed to instanciate finder class "{0}"
75="{0}" not set in service descriptor "{1}"
83=Failed to set properties on {0}
84=Failed to create connector from Uri: {0}
93=Failed to receive event over: {0} (timeout={1})
115=The Endpoint Uri scheme "{0}" is not compatible with Connector "{1}"
126=Endpoint "{0}" not found
128=Failed to dispatch event on replyTo destination "{0}"
130=Crypto strategy is: {0}
206=Endpoint scheme must be compatible with the connector scheme. Connector is: "{0}", endpoint is "{1}"
217=Failed to set interface binding proxy "{0}" on service component "{1}"
218=This interface already has one router associated with it. If you want to bind to an interface with more than one method you need to configure the method names explicitly on the bindings.
219=Cannot find binding for method name "{0}"
221=There are at least 2 connectors matching protocol "{0}", so the connector to use must be specified on the endpoint using the ''connector'' property/attribute. Connectors in your configuration that support "{0}" are: {1}

#Post Mule 1.4
223=Failed to get output stream
225=Both "class" and "method" attributes must be configured on this component if no "delegateInstance" provided
226=No "class" must be specified if "ref" is specified for this component

#Post Mule 2.0
227=No service descriptor found for transport: "{0}".  This transport does not appear to be installed.
229=Unrecognised servce type: "{0}"
230=ServiceFinder unable to locate the real service "{0}"

#231="Model name on descriptor: "{0}" is "{1}" but doesn't match the model being registered on: "{2}"
233=The endpoint "{0}" is not an outbound endpoint. Outbound endpoints must be used with the outbound router "{1}
235=The endpoint "{0}" is not a outbound endpoint. Outbound endpoints must be used with the exception strategy "{1}

270=Failed to create proxy for {0}
# Reconnection strategies
275=No Routing path for split message. Check splitter router settings. Service name is "{0}", message part is "{1}" If you want to ignore some message parts add failIfNoMatch=false to your splitter router config

# 227 in Mule 1.4
312=Failed to start inbound endpoint "{0}"
313=Failed to stop inbound endpoint "{0}"
323=Exchange pattern "{0}" for {1} endpoint {2} is not supported by the connector
326=Only Outbound endpoints can be dynamic
327=Dynamic endpoints must specify a scheme.  This is the only part of the URI that cannot be dynamic
