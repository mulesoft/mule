/**
 * Verify that no inbound messages are lost when exceptions occur.  
 * The message must either make it all the way to the SEDA queue (in the case of 
 * an asynchronous inbound endpoint), or be restored/rolled back at the source.
 * 
 * In the case of JDBC, this will cause the ACK query to not be executed and therefore 
 * the source data will still be present the next time the database is polled.
