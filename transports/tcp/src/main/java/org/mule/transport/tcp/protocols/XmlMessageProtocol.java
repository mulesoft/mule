/**
 * <p>
 * The XmlMessageProtocol is an application level tcp protocol that can be used to
 * read streaming xml documents. The only requirement is that each document include
 * an xml declaration at the beginning of the document of the form "<?xml...". In
 * section 2.8, the xml 1.0 standard contains "Definition: XML documents
 * <strong>SHOULD</strong> begin with an XML declaration which specifies the version
 * of XML being used" while the xml 1.1 standard contains "Definition: XML 1.1
 * documents <strong>MUST</strong> begin with an XML declaration which specifies the
 * version of XML being used". The SHOULD indicates a recommendation that, if not
 * followed, needs to be carefully checked for unintended consequences. MUST
 * indicates a mandatory requirement for a well-formed document. Please make sure
 * that the xml documents being streamed begin with an xml declaration when using
 * this class.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Data are read until a new document is found or there are no more data
 * (momentarily).  For slower networks,
 * {@link org.mule.transport.tcp.protocols.XmlMessageEOFProtocol} may be more reliable.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Also, the default character encoding for the platform is used to decode the
 * message bytes when looking for the XML declaration. Some caution with message
 * character encodings is warranted.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Finally, this class uses a PushbackInputStream to enable parsing of individual
 * messages. The stream stores any pushed-back bytes into it's own internal buffer
 * and not the original stream. Therefore, the read buffer size is intentionally
 * limited to insure that unread characters remain on the stream so that all data may
 * be read later.
 * </p>
