MIGRATION GUIDE
===============

The following is a list of changes you have to execute to migrate from Mule ESB Community edition version 3.4.x to version 3.5.0.
Please check http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Mule+Release+Notes for more details.

MULE-6968: In the previous version, requests to "/" were only received by an HTTP endpoint when no path was defined, and rejected if path was set to "" or "/". Now requests are received by the endpoint in any of the three cases.
MULE-7013: keepSendSocketOpen attribute in the HTTP/S connector is deprecated. It is inherited from TCP Connector but has no effect on outbound HTTP connections and will be removed in the future.
MULE-7023: The keep-alive attribute in inbound and outbound HTTP/S endpoints is renamed to keepAlive.
MULE-7011: org.mule.util.queue.Queue class now has a clear() method to discard all elements in the queue while leaving the queue still usable. If you have your own implementation of a Mule Queue you'll need to implement it
MULE-7010: ObjectStore class now has a clear() method which discards all elements while leaving the store still usable. If you have your own implementation of ObjectStore you'll need to implement this method
MULE-7090: Mule will use the default security provider and TLSv1 as default algorithm for secure socket connections
           tlsProtocolHandler attribute from TLS configuration in SSL/TLS/smtps/jettry https transports is deprecated and will
           be ignored. Mule uses the default settings defined in the JVM platform. This parameter is no longer needed in
           supported JDKs.
MULE-7061: Jetty transport is now using Jetty 8. Applications using a custom jetty.xml configuration file must update the Jetty classes referenced in this file due to package names changed from version 6 to 7, as explained here: http://wiki.eclipse.org/Jetty/Starting/Porting_to_Jetty_7/Packages_and_Classes
MULE-7138: MD5MuleEventKeyGenerator is now deprecated, a new implementation is provided: SHA256MuleEventKeyGenerator.
MULE-7097: A new configuration file 'conf/tls-default.conf' has been added. This file defines two properties, that allow to limit the cipher suites and protocols used by Mule in SSL sockets.
MULE-7103: There is now a new system property 'mule.security.model' that may be used to alter the security setup of Mule and its modules. If not defined, or defined with the value 'default',
            no restrictions will apply and Mule will read the TLS configuration from the file 'conf/tls-default.conf'.
            If defined with the value 'fips140-2' Mule will work with a Fips compliant security model: any cryptographic modes of operation not approved in the standard will be disabled
            (the pgp module will be disabled, and the TLS configuration properties will be read from 'conf/tls-fips140-2.conf'). Note that full compliance also requires a certified JCE provider installed.
MULE-7390: The following transformers no longer support external entities out of the box: xslt-transformer, dom-to-xml-transformer, xml-to-dom-transformer
            dom-to-output-handler-transformer, xquery-transformer. For cases in which external entities processing is needed, the attribute acceptExternalEntities has been added
            as optional (defaults to false). Use this attribute with extreme care in cases in which you trust the source only.
MULE-7425: xpath() MEL function no longer changes the message payload when a source is provided. So for example, the expression xpath('catalog/cd/title') may change the message payload, while xpath('catalog/cd/title', flowVars['xml']) will never do
MULE-7439: org.mule.transport.http.servlet.MuleHttpServletResponse.formatDate now receives a StringBuilder instead of a StringBuffer
MULE-7428: Mule queues underlying implementation has changed. To get previous behaviour you can set system property mule.queue.oldmode=true. Old classes were deprecated and moved to package org.mule.util.queue.objectstore
