MIGRATION GUIDE
===============

The following is a list of changes you have to execute to migrate from Mule ESB Community edition version 3.4.x to version 3.7.x
Please check https://developer.mulesoft.com/docs/display/current/Mule+ESB for more details.

Migration changes from 3.6.0 to 3.6.x
MULE-9337: TLSv1 is no longer listed as an enabled protocol, by default only TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 will be enabled. If you wish to use TLSv1 you can edit the TLS configuration file (tls-default.conf) and add it back to the enabled protocols entry.
MULE-9405: MuleException instead of NPE is now thrown when setting a null value for a context-property in an XstlTransformation.
MULE-9522: jruby was upgraded to version 1.7.24. Also, the following dependencies were updated:
    * bytelist: from version 1.0.10 to 1.0.11
    * jcodings: 1.0.10 to 1.0.16
    * jffi: 1.2.9 to 1.2.10 (-native too)
    * jline: removed
    * jnr-constants: 0.8.4 to 0.9.0
    * jnr-enxio: 0.4 to 0.9
    * jnr-ffi: 1.0.4 to 2.0.5 (shaded into mule-module-scripting-jruby)
    * jnr-posix: 2.5.2 to 3.0.27
    * jnr-unixsocket: 0.3 to 0.8
    * joni: 2.0.0 to 2.1.9
    * jruby-core: 1.7.4 to 1.7.24 (shaded into mule-module-scripting-jruby)
    * jruby-stdlib: 1.7.4 to 1.7.24
    * jzlib: 1.1.2 to 1.1.3
    * nailgun-server: 0.9.1 (new)
    * options: 1.3 (new)
    * yecht: 1.1 (new)
MULE-9501: The wildcard-filter will only work with prefix (*.log), suffix (java.util.*) or enclosing strings (*util*) patterns, as well as the deprecated payload based filter (java.lang.Throwable+) and regular strings.
    In any other case no match will be possible, regardless of the input. The regex-filter should be used for other cases.
    This also affects the wildcard patterns allowed by the file-wildcard-filter, request-wildcard-filter, expression-filter, message-property-filter, exceptions strategies commit-transaction and rollback transaction exception patterns, wildcard patterns used in expressions, among others (complete list can be found in https://www.mulesoft.org/jira/browse/MULE-9501).
MULE-10686: XML entity expansion in Jersey is now disabled by default because it allows DoS attacks. To restore previous behaviour use the mule.xml.expandInternalEntities=true property.
MULE-10306: XML entity expansion in XML transformers is now disabled by default because it allows DoS attacks. To restore previous behaviour use the mule.xml.expandInternalEntities=true property.
MULE-10979: The default response timeout and default transaction timeout can't be configured using system properties on the command line or in the wrapper.conf file anymore. In replacement, use the configuration element. For example: <configuration defaultResponseTimeout="20000"  defaultTransactionTimeout="40000"/>.
MULE-11118: The HTTP listener now replies with status code 503 when the thread pool is exhausted (and poolExhaustedAction="ABORT") instead of closing the socket.
MULE-11825: In a DB template query, to set a DB param with the null value, you can use the "NULL" literal value. For example: <db:in-param name="name" defaultValue="NULL"/>

Migration changes from 3.5.x to 3.6.x

MULE-7774: All date related headers for the HTTP transport are now in GMT following RFC2616. To maintain the previous behaviour where the Date header was in the server's time zone, you can set system property mule.http.dateheaderservertimezone to true.
MULE-7755: Patterns module is deprecated and will be removed in Mule 4.0.
MULE-7857: The RemoteDispatcher and related classes in the client module have been deprecated and will be removed in Mule 4.0.

MULE-7842: Jersey was upgraded to version 2.11 which implements jax-rs 2.0. Applications using the jersey module will need upgrading. For further reference see Jersey's migration guide at https://jersey.java.net/documentation/latest/migration.html#mig-1.x
MULE-7842: javax.annotation:javax.annotation-api was upgraded to version 1.2. We're now importing this dependency directly while before we did it through the geronimo-specs project
MULE-6866: Groovy was upgraded to version 2.3.7-indy. If this produces any compatibility issues with an existing script you should either update your script (recommended) or go back to a prior version by replacing the groovy jar at MULE_HOME/lib/opt
MULE-7906: Jython 2.7.3b3 is now part of the distribution. You no longer need to install the scripting pack or include it on your app. If this produces any compatibility issues with an existing script you should either update your application/installation (recommended) or replace/delete the jython jar at MULE_HOME/lib/opt
MULE-7740: Rhino 1.7R4 is now part of the distribution. You no longer need to install the scripting pack or include it on your app. If this produces any compatibility issues with an existing script you should either update your application/installation (recommended) or replace/delete the rhino and js-engine jars at MULE_HOME/lib/opt
MULE-7946: The following dependencies were removed from the distribution since they're no longer necessary as 1.7 is now the minimum required JDK version for running mule:
    * geronimo-j2ee-management_1.0_spec-1.1.jar
    * jaxb-api-2.1.jar
    * jaxws-api-2.2.1.jar

MULE-7951: xmlunit has been upgraded to version 1.5
MULE-7919: json-schema-validation-filter in the json module was deprecated and will be removed in Mule 4.0. Use the new validate-schema message processor instead.
MULE-7919: The following classes have been deprecated. Use JsonSchemaValidator instead
    * JsonSchemaFilter
    * JsonSchemaJsonValidationFilter
    * JsonSchemaValidationFilter
    * JsonSChemaXsdValidationFilter
MULE-7919: The following dependencies were upgraded:
    * jackson-databind: from version 2.1.1 to 2.4.3
    * joda-time: from version 1.6 to 2.5
MULE-7919: The dependency org.kitchen-eel:json-schema-validator was removed and replaced with com.github.fge:json-schema-validator:2.2.5. If you still need to use that dependency, you can safely add it back to your application/runtime.
MULE-7987: The following dependencies were upgraded:
    * saxon: from version 9.1.0.8 to 9.6.0.1-HE
    * woodstox-core-asl: from version 4.1.4 to 4.4.1
    * stax2-api: from version 3.1.1 to 3.1.4
MULE-7030: The following features have been deprecated in favor of <expression-filter>:
    * jaxen-filter
    * jxpath-filter
MULE-7030: The following features have been deprecated in favor of <expression-transformer>:
    * jxpath-extractor-transformer
    * bean: expression evaluator
MULE-7030: The following features have been deprecated in favor of the new xpath3() MEL Function
    * xpath: expression evaluator
    * xpath2: expression evaluator (in favor of the xpath3() MEL function)
    * xpath() MEL Function
MULE-7030: The xpath-filter element is now namespace aware. If you're using it with XPath expressions which reference custom namespaces, you now have to declare them in a namespace-manager element or use a wildcard (*:/title instead of book:title)
MULE-8001: The xquery-transformer element will now always return a java List when no return type has explicitly been specified
MULE-7983: Devkit based Cloud Connectors with OAuth support will now use the new HTTP connector by default, unless the useTransportForUris configuration flag is set to true (see MULE-8066). The connector-ref attribute now accepts either an HTTP transport 'config' or a new 'listener-config' element. Devkit based connectors using OAuth1 will not support the new HTTP connector
MULE-7731: The default value of the 'cacheJmsSessions' attribute in the JMS connector element is now 'true' to provide better out of the box performance.  This attribute can be set 'false' to disable caching as in 3.5.
MULE-7731: The <jms:caching-connection-factory> has been deprecated.  It can still but used in 3.6, but it not necessary given that from Mule 3.6 JMS connections cache Sessions/Producers by default when a CachingConnectionFactory has not been configured explicitly.
MULE-7731: org.mule.transport.jms.xa.ConnectionFactoryWrapper has been renamed to org.mule.transport.jms.xa.DefaultXAConnectionFactoryWrapper.
MULE-8082: XStream was upgraded from version 1.4.2 to 1.4.7
MULE-8083: JXPath expression evaluator no longer accepts external entities when payload is not already a Document
MULE-7736: From Mule 3.6, SEDA queues used with the 'queued-asynchronous' processing strategy are now bound to four times the maximum number of active threads by default.  This change permits stages to be decoupled as well as peaks in traffic to be handled while avoiding OutOfMemoryException's.  The queue size can be increased in configuration or set to '-1' for 3.5 behaviour (unbound).
MULE-8004: Examples are no longer included in the distribution. Check the README file in the examples folder for more information
MULE-7736: From Mule 3.6, SEDA queues used with the 'queued-asynchronous' processing strategy and services are now bound to four times the maximum number of active threads by default.  This change permits stages to be decoupled as well as peaks in traffic to be handled while avoiding OutOfMemoryException's.  The queue size can be increased in configuration or set to '-1' for 3.5 behaviour (unbound).
MULE-8004: Remove examples from the distribution
MULE-8315: the following Apache Tomcat libraries were upgraded form version 6.0.29 to version 6.0.41: annotations-api, coyote, el-api, jasper, jasper-el, jsp-api, juli. Removed catalina-6.0.29.jar as is not needed anymore.
MULE-8308: jruby was upgraded to version 1.7.4 because of a security issue with previous version. Artifact jruby-complete was removed and replaced with jruby-core and its dependencies.
MULE-8430: in previous versions of Mule, domain home folders where created relative to current working directory instead of relative to <MULE_HOME> folder.
           Now that this is fixed, if your Mule instance was started from a folder other than <MULE_HOME> then folder <WORKING_DIRECTORY>/.mule/<DOMAIN_NAME> must be moved to <MULE_HOME>/.mule/<DOMAIN_NAME>
MULE-8645: jasper-jdt-6.0.29 is not included anymore on Mule distributions because of some detected vulnerabilities. In case this artifact is needed, when using drools for example, then manually add it on <MULE_HOME>/lib/opt
MULE-9020: BouncyCastle was upgraded to version 1.50.
     Note: DESede algorithm now requires keys of 16 or 24 bytes unlike the prior version which required 16 or 22 bytes.
MULE-9306: Losing flow and session variables when using MuleClient to dispatch/send an event. Exception strategy not caching exceptions after using MuleClient on a JavaComponent.
