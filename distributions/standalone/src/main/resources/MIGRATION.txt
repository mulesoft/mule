MIGRATION GUIDE
===============

The following is a list of changes you have to execute to migrate from Mule ESB Community edition version 3.4.x to version 3.5.0.
Please check http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Mule+Release+Notes for more details.

MULE-7620: org.mule.api.endpoint.EndpointFactory.getOutboundEndpoint(..) now returns an outbound endpoint without the behaviour of execution the endpoint in the current thread or a dispatcher thread.
To make it work as in previous version you must use org.mule.api.endpoint.OutboundEndpointExecutorFactory.getOutboundEndpointExecutor(..) that's return an outbound endpoint with the execution context logic.
You must provide an ExceptionHandler as a parameter. You can get the exception handler using dependency injection by implementing org.mule.api.exception.MessagingExceptionHandlerAware
