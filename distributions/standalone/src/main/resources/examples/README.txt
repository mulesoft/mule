The Mule examples can be built using either of the following build tools:
    Ant (version 1.6.5 or newer)   http://ant.apache.org
    Maven (version 2.0.8 or newer)   http://maven.apache.org

Although Maven aims to make your build simple, the process itself is quite 
complex, so if you are not familiar with either tool, you will most likely want 
to start with Ant.

Many of the examples are ready to run out-of-the-box and it is not necessary for 
you to build them.  However, some require additional libraries not included as 
part of the Mule distribution.  When this is the case, the additional libraries 
will be downloaded into the $MULE_HOME/lib/user directory upon building the 
example.
