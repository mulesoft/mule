Mule IDE 1.2.1

JIRA ticket http://jira.symphonysoft.com/browse/MULETOOLS-8

* When creating a Mule project, the wizard now gives you a per-project choice 
  of whether to copy the libraries from the plugin or an external installation. 
* The preferences now specify the default values when creating a project rather 
  than applying to all projects. 
* When creating a project from an external install, the wizard attempts to 
  create source and javadoc attachments pointing into the distribution.
  
JIRA ticket http://jira.symphonysoft.com/browse/MULETOOLS-14

* Adds support for creating a project based on a sample. Copies the source code 
  and configuration files, then sets up configs/config sets for the files.
  NOTE: For the loanbroker sample, you have to manually copy the Axis libs into
  the project after it is created. Hopefully, the next version will allow for
  auto-inclusion of the optional libs.
* Adds option for creating an empty project including all the jars and a 
  basic config file.
